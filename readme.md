We've open-sourced this project to help others in their journey to build ML-powered applications. It represents only one of many ML-driven solutions to common business problems.

The app was built using [Turi Create](https://github.com/apple/turicreate) and [Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) powered by the [Skafos.ai](https://www.skafos.ai) platform. 

The boots are sourced from [Zappo's](https://www.zappos.com) and updated models are retrained daily and ready for delivery by just clicking the "Check for Updates" button in the app.
