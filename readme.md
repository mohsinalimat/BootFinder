We've open-sourced this project to help others in their journey to build ML-powered applications. It represents only one of many ML-driven solutions to common business problems.

The app was built using [Turi Create](https://github.com/apple/turicreate) and [Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) powered by the [Skafos.ai](https://www.skafos.ai) platform. 

The boots are sourced from [Zappo's](https://www.zappos.com) and updated models are retrained daily and ready for delivery by just clicking the "Check for Updates" button in the app.

Please let us know how we can make this better by emailing [us](mailto:info@skafos.ai) or visiting our website.

*Fire it up!*
